I am a stock assessment scientists in the FRAM Population Ecology Program at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, WA. I conduct stock assessments for U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks (such as [Big Skate in 2019](https://github.com/iantaylor-NOAA/BigSkate_Doc)) and help support the [Stock Synthesis](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/) modeling framework and the [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/) package for working with it.
